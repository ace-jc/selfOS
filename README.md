# selfOS
OS to organize self

<h2>Summary:</h2>
Starting a project to help organize self. Will contain some hardcoded sections and hopefully will move to a more dynamic model later on. As Walt Disney said this "will change time and time again".


<h2>Architecture:</h2>
The general idea with the architecture is to have all aspects stored locally and synced to multi-cloud setup. A synchronization process will ensure the local storage is synced with the multi cloud backups. Long term the clouds will also be able to update the local storage node (for remote writes).

<h2>User interface:</h2>
User interface will be hosted on a local webserver. 

<h2>Data storage:</h2>
Data will all be hosted locally and will periodically encrypt and backup to remote multi-cloud data repositories.

<h2>Top level organization:</h2>
